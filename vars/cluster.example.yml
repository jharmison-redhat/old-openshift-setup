create_users: yes       # You should only disable this if you're not trying to deploy much of anything
autoscale: yes          # You should only disable this if you know your workload will fit on your cluster as is
add_metrics_storage: yes # You should only disable this if you don't want presistent metrics (and to be free of Insights warnings)
deploy_catalog: yes     # Disable if you don't want the RedHatGov Operator Catalog applied to your cluster
metrics_storage_class: gp3-csi # You should update this to some storageclass available in your default deployment (else disable)
# If not using letsencrypt, uncomment the following and provide a
#   path to a locally-generated fullchain certificate and key that your computer
#   trusts in PEM format if you want to bring your own certificates to the

# The name of the cluster.
# IF PROVISIONING:
#   This value will be in your DNS entries and should conform to valid DNS characters.

#   This should be the first part of your cluster's base address
#   e.g. for cluster-nisky-c592.nisky-c592.example.opentlc.com, this would be

#   Example: If you set this to `example.com`, a DNS entry for `<cluster_name>.example.com` will be created
